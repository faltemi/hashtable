# hashtable
C hashtable testing for use in my interpreter project.
Followed this tutorial to get me started: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=2Ti5yvumFTU&t=782s

Goal is to create reusable hash table struct for my interpreter's memory management and builtin function lookup. 

Note: Does not check for existing entry. ToDo: Pull updates from interpreter project into this repo.
